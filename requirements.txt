# this is just barebones quick-fix to get the streamlit cloud app to work again
# one of its dependencies that had been working fine just started failing at runtime
# streamlit cloud uses the requirements.txt to create its virtual machine
# the other file in the this repo - requirements.txt.main, should be renamed and used for local installs
