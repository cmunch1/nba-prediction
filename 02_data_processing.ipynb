    "### Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "Games.csv and ranking.csv will be merged after initial data processing. Since all the features are *post* game data (final score, winning percentage after the game, etc...) they cannot be used as predictors for the current game. All the features will be used as predictors for the \"next game\", so the data will need to adjusted so that the TARGET (HOME_TEAM_WINS) is in the same row as the predictors. \n",
    "\n",
    "The easiest approach seems to be add a field called TARGET that denotes whether the home team won its *next* game or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "Game_details.csv will intially be held in reserve for feature engineering. With a roster of 24 players per game and 21 features per player, the initial plan is NOT to add all these 500 features indiscriminately but to instead try to find useful features and incorporate these.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scaling and power-transforms will not be used at this time since the plan is to use GBTs (gradient boosted trees) such as XGBoost where this is not needed. These transforms may be needed later for PCA and other techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "duplicates\n",
    "\n",
    " - both games.csv and ranking.csv contain several duplicated rows from Dec 2020 (covid season) that the pandas function *df.duplicated()* failed to detect in EDA. These will be filtered out using subsets instead of the entire dataframe.\n",
